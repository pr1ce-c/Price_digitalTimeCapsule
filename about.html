            <br> Since she was a child, art has always been a primary interest–she is often found creating, admiring, or even criticizing pieces of art. This can be attributed to her interest in comic book art and animation, having grown up watching a variety of classic Marvel, DC, and Disney/Pixar films and shows of the mid-2000s–shows that still inspire her work to this day. While she mainly works in more traditional mediums, she’s taken the past few years to really familiarize herself with digital and graphic art, often posting both her finished and in-progress works on ArtStation.<br> 
            <br>She also takes a great interest in music, typically listening to the melodic tunes of artists like Frank Ocean, Daniel Caesar, Tame Impala, Yerin Baek, or Steve Lacy–sometimes with the volume in her headphones turned a bit too loud. You can get a good grasp of her music taste through her Spotify profile, where she’s compiled a multitude of ever-changing personal playlists, playlists that demonstrate her evolution of music taste since her first creating her Spotify account in 2017. Her more recent playlists you can find displayed on this website, under the “Likes” page.<br>
           
            

            <br>Cianna also takes a great interest in traveling: whether it be a simple day trip through the city, or a week-long stay out of the country, she always enjoys capturing what makes each location unique from the rest. A good majority of her travels are posted on her Instagram; other photos that don’t quite make the cut are kept and organized into various photo albums on her phone.
