Proj 1 for DES 228
# Project Overview
his site is part of DES 228’s first project: The Digital Time Capsule. Meant to demonstrate our likes and interests in the form of our digital presence and engagements, this project’s purpose is to display a multi-page site that includes an introductory bio, our “current likes”, and our current digital activity. This project emphasizes our digital presence in relation to what we find interest in, rather than our interests themselves; in this case specifically, my self-made collection of Spotify playlists and a general display of my social media feed.

# Technical Overview 
Creating this site involved a combination of HTML and CSS, done through Visual Studio Code.
